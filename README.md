## Hi there 👋

I am a PhD student at [the College of Computer Science and Technology](http://www.en.cs.zju.edu.cn/), [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/). 

I am now working on the Audio Research Team at Zhejiang University, under the supervision of [Prof. Zhou Zhao](https://person.zju.edu.cn/zhaozhou). 

I graduated from [Chu Kochen Honors College](http://ckc.zju.edu.cn/ckcen/main.htm), Zhejiang University (浙江大学竺可桢学院), with dual bachelor's degrees in Computer Science and Automation.

My research interests include **Singing voice Synthesis and Music Generation**. Now I focus on the Controllable Music Large Language Model. 

**I am actively seeking postdoctoral positions and research collaborations. Please feel free to contact me via email at yuzhang34@zju.edu.cn**
