## Hi there 👋

I am a PhD student at [the College of Computer Science and Technology](http://www.en.cs.zju.edu.cn/), [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) (浙江大学计算机学院).

I am now working on the Audio Research Team at Zhejiang University, under the supervision of [Prof. Zhou Zhao (赵洲)](https://person.zju.edu.cn/zhaozhou). My current research focuses on multi-task music large language model with style control and spatial audio generation.

I graduated from [Chu Kochen Honors College](http://ckc.zju.edu.cn/ckcen/main.htm), Zhejiang University (浙江大学竺可桢学院), with dual bachelor's degrees in Computer Science and Automation.  
I also worked as a visiting scholar at [University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/), collaborating with [Prof. Przemyslaw Grabowicz](https://www.cics.umass.edu/about/directory/przemyslaw-grabowicz).

My research interests include **Singing Voice Synthesis, Music Generation, and Natural Language Processing**. I have published first-author papers at top international AI conferences, including NeurIPS, AAAI, ACL, and EMNLP.

**I am actively seeking postdoctoral positions and research collaborations. Please feel free to contact me via email at yuzhang34@zju.edu.cn.**
